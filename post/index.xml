      <description>At GoWi.Fi we use NFC in our GoWi.Fi signs and have been bravely waiting for Apple to join everyone else in supporting NFC tags since Google added NFC functionality to Android in late 2010.
At WWDC 2017 in June Apple announced that iOS 11 would have support for reading NFC tags and NDEF messages.
With Apple’s event on Sept. 12th, 2017 Apple has finally announced the new iPhone 8 and the iPhone X.</description>

      <description>We have been working around the clock to have our e-shop working, get an instruction video ready and build a nicer front page. We hope we have managed to do that, you will be our judge, but don&amp;rsquo;t be to harsh.
Static website generators and Snipcart We built our website with our favorite website builder Appernetic.io that use the static website generator Hugo. To make the e-shop we have used Snipcart.</description>
