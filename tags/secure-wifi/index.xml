      <description>If you are renting out your home on AirBnB, Booking.com etc or have a small business you may want to offer free WiFi access for clients. To do that in a secure way you donâ€™t want to connect them to your own local network (LAN) where you have your computers, NAS backup and IoT devices connected.
You want to have an isolated network that is only for your guests. In technical terms you have to create something that is called a VPN or VLAN - virtual private network or virtual local area network.</description>
